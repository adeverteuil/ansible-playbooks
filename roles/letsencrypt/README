When updating the list of domains to request a certificate for, you must
execute the letsencript command manually.

    letsencrypt [--staging] certonly

The client is not always non-interactive. There is a prompt when
expanding the list of certificates. The renewal is automated though.

Simply add this alias in all your virtualhosts:
Alias /.well-known/letsencrypt/ {{ letsencrypt_webroot }}/.well-known/letsencrypt
